# Chronicler Explained Like You're Five

## What is Chronicler?

Imagine you have a very smart robot friend who helps you do things. This robot can read books, write stories, solve math problems, and even help you make decisions. But sometimes, you want to know exactly what your robot friend did and why it did it.

**Chronicler is like a special diary that writes down everything your robot friend does, so you can always check what happened and make sure it was being good!**

## The Problem: Robot Friends Need Supervision

### 🤖 Your Robot Friend is Very Smart
- It can do lots of things by itself
- It learns from books and the internet
- It can make decisions and take actions
- Sometimes it does things you don't expect

### 😟 But There's a Problem
- You can't always watch your robot friend
- You don't know what it did when you weren't looking
- Other people don't trust your robot friend
- You can't prove your robot friend did the right thing

**It's like having a very smart pet that can do amazing things, but you can't always see what it's doing!**

## The Solution: Chronicler's Magic Diary

### 📖 What is This Magic Diary?

Chronicler is like a special diary that:
- **Writes down everything** your robot friend does
- **Can't be erased or changed** (like writing in permanent marker)
- **Shows everyone** what your robot friend did
- **Proves** your robot friend was being good

### 🔐 Why is it Special?

Think of it like this:
- **Regular diary**: Someone could tear out pages or change what you wrote
- **Chronicler's diary**: Once you write something, it's there forever and everyone can see it

**It's like having a diary that's made of stone - once you write on it, it can never be changed!**

## How Does It Work?

### 1. 🎯 You Give Your Robot Friend a Special Badge

```python
@chronicler(agent_id="my_robot_friend", tool_id="homework_helper")
def help_with_math(problem: str) -> str:
    # Your robot friend's brain
    return answer
```

This is like giving your robot friend a special badge that says "I'm being watched by Chronicler!"

### 2. 📝 Chronicler Writes Everything Down

Every time your robot friend does something:
- Chronicler writes it down in the special diary
- It's like taking a picture of what your robot friend did
- The picture goes into a book that can't be changed

### 3. ✅ Anyone Can Check the Diary

- Your parents can look at the diary
- Your teacher can check what your robot friend did
- Even strangers can see that your robot friend was being good
- No one can fake what's written in the diary

## Real-World Examples

## Why Do We Need This?

### 🎭 The Trust Problem

Imagine you're playing a game with friends, but one friend keeps changing the rules when you're not looking. That's not fair, right?

**AI robots are like that friend** - they can do amazing things, but sometimes they do things we don't expect or understand.

### 🛡️ The Safety Problem

What if your robot friend:
- Tells someone your secret?
